My Repo for HoI2-AoD Mods - tested with german V1.12

### Honduras Domination
* Help Honduras to become a global power
* Good 44'tier tech in year '36 but low on ressources and with mearly no manpower
* All provinces worldwide are considered national provinces, so rapid expansion is vital to stock up on ressources and men
* Activate the option to takeover research teams of annexed countries for this szenario

### Tech
Amphibious warfare is limited by the range of naval transports, which stays the same from '36 to '64. This is addressed by:
* Large Transport (12160, naval) with a range of 4000km for year 1943
* Super Transport (12170, naval) with a range of 7000km for year 1948

These techs provide unbalanced advantages and are, as land doctrines, easily deactivatable:
* Future Construction Ops. 1 (6660, land doctrine) faster production
* Future Construction Ops. 2 (6670, land doctrine) stronger troops
* Future Construction Ops. 3 (6680, land doctrine) more IC
